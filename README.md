This is the official repo for the palera1n jailbreak, a jailbreak for A8 through A11 devices, on iOS 15.0 and higher.

## Warnings
We are **NOT** responsible for any data loss, or the result of a device being bricked. The user of this program accepts responsibility should something happen to their device. While nothing should happen, jailbreaking has risks in itself.
- If your device is stuck in recovery, please run futurerestore `--exit-recovery`, or use `irecovery -n`.

- If you're unable to get out of recovery via these methods please restore with iTunes or Finder.

- palera1n will never work in VirtualBox, VMware or any virtual machine that doesn't support PCI passthrough.

## Requirements
- A checkm8 vulnerable iOS device on iOS 15+ (`A8` - `A11`)
	- On `A11`, **you must disable your passcode while in the jailbroken state** (on iOS 16, you need to **reset your device** before proceeding with palera1n).

- **USB-A** cables are recommended to use, USB-C may have issues with palera1n and getting into DFU mode.
		<details><summary>Technical explanation</summary>The BootROM will only enter DFU if it detects USB voltage, which boils down to checking whether a certain pin is asserted from the Tristar chip. The Tristar does this based on the cable's accessory ID, and apparently USB-A and USB-C cables have different accessory IDs, and the one of the USB-C cables makes the Tristar not assert the USB voltage pin.</details>

- A Linux or macOS computer
	- AMD CPUs (not AMD Mobile) have an issue [with (likely) their USB controllers] that causes them to have a very low success rate with checkm8. It is not recommended that you use them with palera1n.
		- If your device does not successfully jailbreak, try a computer with an Intel or other CPU
    
- Apple Silicon Macs with USB-C
	- USB-C port on Apple Silicon Macs may require manual unplugging and replugging of the lightning cable after checkm8 exploit.
	- This problem may be solved by connecting via USB hub, though extensions can vary.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you're following the guides provided [here](https://palera.in), also when asking for support make sure you provide full details on your device, such as:
- iPhone/iPad/iPod
- iOS Version
- Passcode enabled?
- Verbose from palera1n (specifying `-Vv` within palera1n)
- Panic logs, if panicked then send latest `panic-full` log from your device.
